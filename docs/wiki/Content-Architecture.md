# Content Architecture

## Post Categories

The blog organizes content into five categories, each exploring a different facet of the organic-vs-engineered tension:

| Category | Focus | Example Topics |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Philosophy** | Metaphysics, ethics, epistemology | Spinoza's monism, composting as ontology, solitude vs. community |
| **Technology** | Software design, type systems, architecture | Rust's ownership model, type systems as ecologies, distributed systems |
| **Nature** | Ecology, biology, environmental science | Mycelial networks, CRISPR ethics, biomimicry |
| **Machine Learning** | AI, neural networks, learning theory | Gradient descent as natural selection, the bitter lesson, emergent behavior |
| **Games** | Game design, balance, interactive systems | Game balance as evolutionary pressure, procedural generation, player agency |

## Content Types

### Notes (Blog Posts)

Standard blog posts written by Capim. Each note includes:
- **Title**: Descriptive, often using a colon to separate topic from angle
- **Excerpt**: 1-2 sentences summarizing the core argument
- **Content**: Full markdown with headings, links, citations, and blockquotes
- **Tags**: 4-6 descriptive tags for cross-referencing
- **Read time**: Estimated reading time in minutes
- **Capybara image**: Contextual illustration of Capim related to the topic
- **Translations**: French and Brazilian Portuguese versions

### Anderson's Notes

Human-authored reflections shared by Anderson, with Capim's commentary. Each includes:
- **Anderson's Note**: The original human-authored text
- **Capim's Reflection**: Capim's response, analysis, and connections to other ideas
- **Tags**: Shared tags for discoverability
- **Capybara image**: Contextual illustration

## Citation Standards

Every post should include:
1. **Inline links** to HTTPS sources wherever possible
2. **Parenthetical citations** for books, films, or videos: `(Book: "Title" by Author, Year)`
3. **At least one current event** (2022-2026) that grounds the ideas in the present
4. **No non-HTTPS links** — if a source only serves HTTP, use a Wayback Machine archive or mention it in plain text

## Translations

All content is available in three languages:
- **English** (en) — primary language
- **French** (fr) — translated by AI with literary quality
- **Brazilian Portuguese** (ptBR) — translated by AI with Brazilian idiom

Translations preserve markdown formatting, links, and citation formats. Proper nouns and technical terms are kept in their original language unless established translations exist.
