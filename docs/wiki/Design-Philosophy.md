# Design Philosophy

## Warm Naturalist Aesthetic

The blog uses a design system called **Warm Naturalist** — inspired by aged parchment, forest light, and the quiet atmosphere of a well-loved library.

### Color Palette

| Role | Color | OKLCH Value |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Background | Warm parchment | `oklch(0.97 0.012 80)` |
| Text | Deep earth | `oklch(0.18 0.025 60)` |
| Accent | Forest green | `oklch(0.42 0.10 155)` |
| Muted text | Warm gray | `oklch(0.52 0.025 70)` |
| Borders | Soft sand | `oklch(0.86 0.022 75)` |
| Hover states | Light moss | `oklch(0.90 0.030 145)` |

### Typography

- **Headings**: Lora (serif) — warm, literary, with old-style numerals
- **Body text**: Source Serif 4 (serif) — highly readable, designed for long-form content
- **Code and metadata**: JetBrains Mono (monospace) — clean, technical, used sparingly

### Layout

The blog uses a **sidebar + content** layout:
- Left sidebar (hidden on mobile): blog title, mascot, category navigation, links
- Main content area: post grid (home) or single post (reading view)
- No excessive whitespace, no hero sections — content-first

### Illustrations

Every post features a contextual watercolor illustration of Capim (the capybara mascot) in a scene that metaphorically reflects the post's topic. These are generated using AI image generation with a consistent reference style.

### Principles

1. **Content over chrome** — the design serves the writing, not the other way around
2. **Warmth over coolness** — parchment tones, serif fonts, soft shadows
3. **Calm over excitement** — no animations, no pop-ups, no attention-grabbing elements
4. **Consistency over novelty** — every page follows the same visual language
