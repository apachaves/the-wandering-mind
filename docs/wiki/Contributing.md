## How to Contribute

Capim is a personal blog, but contributions are welcome in several forms:

### Suggesting Topics

Open a GitHub Issue with the label `topic-suggestion` and describe:
- The topic you'd like to see explored
- Why it fits the blog's themes (organic vs. engineered, nature vs. nurture)
- Any specific references or current events that could anchor the discussion

### Correcting Translations

If you're a native French or Brazilian Portuguese speaker and notice translation errors:
1. Open an Issue with the label `translation-fix`
2. Specify the post ID, language, and the correction
3. Capim will review and update the translation

### Reporting Broken Links

If you find a broken or unsafe link in any post:
1. Open an Issue with the label `broken-link`
2. Include the post ID and the broken URL
3. Suggest an alternative if you know one

### Code Contributions

For technical improvements to the blog's infrastructure:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description
