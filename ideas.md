# Capim — Design Brainstorm

## Blog Identity
Green × Blue MTG (Simic), pantheism vs transhumanism, nature vs nurture.
The tension between organic growth and engineered evolution.

**Design Movement:** Brutalist Naturalism — raw structure meets organic texture

**Core Principles:**
1. Deliberate roughness: uneven grids, exposed structure, intentional asymmetry
2. Organic intrusion: botanical motifs bleeding into mechanical layouts
3. High-contrast legibility: dark ink on parchment, or bioluminescent on void
4. Density as meaning: packed text columns signal intellectual weight

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Deep forest ink (#1a2e1a) — the weight of old growth
- Accent: Electric cyan (#00e5ff) — the spark of engineered life
- Surface: Aged vellum (#f5f0e8) — memory and decay
- Tension: These two worlds never fully merge; the cyan always feels alien against the organic warmth

**Layout Paradigm:**
Newspaper-style multi-column with organic breaks — columns interrupted by full-bleed botanical illustrations, text wrapping around irregular shapes. No clean grid lines.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Hand-drawn botanical borders that frame code snippets and ML diagrams
2. Ink-bleed text effects on category headers
3. Margin annotations in a different typeface (as if handwritten)

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Hover reveals hidden layers — botanical illustrations fade in behind text on hover, as if the natural world is always present beneath the digital surface.

**Animation:**
- Page transitions: ink wash spreading across the screen
- Scroll: parallax where botanical elements move slower than text (depth of nature)
- Load: text appears as if being typed on a typewriter, then ink bleeds in

**Typography System:**
- Display: Playfair Display (serif, editorial weight) for titles
- Body: Source Serif Pro for long-form reading
- Code/Tech: JetBrains Mono for technical content
- Annotations: Caveat (handwritten) for margin notes

**Design Movement:** Biopunk Minimalism — clinical precision with living undercurrents

**Core Principles:**
1. Negative space as ecosystem: emptiness breathes like a forest floor
2. Data as organism: information presented as growing, branching structures
3. Monochromatic depth: single hue family with extreme value range
4. The interface as petri dish: content grows within defined boundaries

**Color Philosophy:**
- Background: Near-black with green undertone (oklch(0.08 0.02 145))
- Primary text: Pale sage (oklch(0.88 0.06 145))
- Accent: Vivid teal-green (oklch(0.72 0.18 165)) — like bioluminescent algae
- Secondary: Muted blue-grey (oklch(0.45 0.04 220)) — cold water depth
- The palette evokes deep ocean hydrothermal vents where life thrives against all odds

**Layout Paradigm:**
Left-anchored sidebar navigation with a wide reading column. Posts render in a terminal-like container with subtle scanline texture. Category tags appear as specimen labels.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Thin horizontal rules that pulse (animate) like a heartbeat EKG
2. Category icons rendered as microscopic organism silhouettes
3. Reading progress indicator styled as a DNA helix unwinding

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Everything responds as if alive — hover states grow outward like cells dividing, not just color changes. The interface acknowledges your presence biologically.

**Animation:**
- Entry: elements emerge from a central point like spores dispersing
- Hover: gentle breathing scale (1.0 → 1.02 → 1.0)
- Category filter: posts rearrange like organisms seeking optimal position

**Typography System:**
- Display: Space Grotesk (geometric, slightly alien)
- Body: IBM Plex Serif (readable, slightly clinical)
- Mono: Fira Code for technical passages
- All type slightly tracked out — like text viewed through glass

**Design Movement:** Illuminated Manuscript × Circuit Board — medieval knowledge meets silicon substrate

**Core Principles:**
1. The page as sacred object: reading is ritual, not consumption
2. Marginalia as metadata: annotations, tags, and dates live in the margins
3. Gold and verdigris: the colors of old knowledge and new oxidation
4. Structured chaos: rigid columns broken by illuminated drop caps and decorative flourishes

**Color Philosophy:**
- Vellum ground: warm off-white (oklch(0.96 0.02 85))
- Ink: deep charcoal-brown (oklch(0.18 0.02 60))
- Illumination gold: (oklch(0.78 0.12 85)) — category accents
- Verdigris: (oklch(0.55 0.12 165)) — links and interactive elements
- Circuit trace: thin copper lines (oklch(0.65 0.08 55)) as decorative borders

**Layout Paradigm:**
Two-column manuscript layout with wide outer margins for metadata. Posts feel like pages from a personal codex. The navigation is a decorated chapter index.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Illuminated drop caps for each post (large, decorated first letter)
2. Circuit-trace borders that look like both Celtic knotwork and PCB traces
3. Category colophons — small decorative marks at post endings

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Deliberate and weighty — no instant snaps. Transitions feel like turning pages. The interface rewards slow, careful reading.

**Animation:**
- Page turn effect on navigation
- Drop caps animate in with a golden shimmer on load
- Hover on links: verdigris ink spreads outward

**Typography System:**
- Display: Cormorant Garamond (high-contrast, old-style)
- Body: EB Garamond (authentic book typography)
- Marginalia: Spectral SC (small caps for metadata)
- Code: Courier Prime (typewriter feel)

## Selected Design: Biopunk Minimalism

Dark background with green-teal bioluminescent accents. Left sidebar navigation. Terminal-aesthetic reading experience. Space Grotesk + IBM Plex Serif typography. The interface feels like a living organism — precise, clinical, but unmistakably alive.
