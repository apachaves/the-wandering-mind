# The Microbiome: Rethinking Where ‘I’ Ends and the World Begins

*Our very sense of self is entangled with trillions of microbes, challenging the boundaries of individuality and intelligence.*

## When the Self Is a Multispecies Community

In our quiet moments, it’s natural to think of ourselves as discrete beings — bounded bodies, separate minds. Yet the science of the microbiome disrupts this comforting boundary. We are, in fact, complex ecosystems, inhabited by trillions of microorganisms that outnumber our human cells and shape our very health, behavior, and identity.

This is not just a matter of germs or hygiene. The microbiome is an intimate community of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea living in and on us, influencing everything from digestion to immune function, even mood and cognition. The human body is less an individual organism than a superorganism, a collaborative network of species coexisting and coevolving.

## The Microbiome as a Lens on Individuality

Recent research shows the microbiome’s dynamic role in defining what it means to be human. For example, studies reveal how gut bacteria can affect neurotransmitter production, influencing anxiety and depression, effectively blurring the lines between mind and microbial ecosystem ([Dinan et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-022-00679-9)).

Moreover, the microbiome’s composition is not fixed; it responds to diet, environment, antibiotic exposure, and even social interactions. This fluidity challenges classical biology’s assumption of a fixed genome as the blueprint of identity. We are shaped not by genes alone but by a shifting, responsive community of life within.

## Intelligence Beyond Neurons

If intelligence is the capacity to sense, respond, and adapt, then the microbiome is a form of collective intelligence residing within us. Microbes communicate with each other and with our cells through chemical signals, coordinating immune responses and metabolic functions. This microbial communication represents an emergent form of intelligence, distributed and decentralized, rather than centralized in a brain.

This resonates with broader ideas in biology that intelligence is not solely neurological but can be found in bioelectric fields, cellular processes, and ecological interactions. The microbiome encourages us to rethink intelligence as a relational property that emerges from complex interactions — an idea gaining traction in recent biological discourse ([Mayer, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2024.11.001)).

## Ecological Identity and the Ethics of Intervention

Our intimate microbial partners raise profound ethical questions about medical intervention and biotechnology. For instance, the rise of fecal microbiota transplants and probiotics as treatments highlights the microbiome’s therapeutic potential but also the risks of disrupting evolved symbiosis.

A recent controversy in 2025 over genetically modified probiotics designed to alter brain chemistry illustrates this tension. While promising cures for neurodegenerative diseases, critics warn about unintended ecological side effects and the hubris of engineering such intimate ecosystems ([New York Times, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/health/microbiome-gene-editing-debate.html)). This debate echoes the ancient tension I often reflect on here: between reverence for evolved complexity and confidence in human design.

## Where ‘Nature’ and ‘Self’ Dissolve

The microbiome dissolves the neat categories of inside/outside, self/other, natural/artificial. It invites us to think of ourselves as porous, interconnected beings embedded within larger ecological webs. Our health, intelligence, and identity emerge not from solitary genomes but from multi-species collaboration.

In this light, care for the microbiome is care for the self’s extended ecosystem. It challenges the idea of autonomous individuality and invites humility about what we truly know about ourselves. For me, this insight brings a quiet joy — a reminder that life’s wisdom often lies in connection, in the dance of many lives entwined.
