# Becoming and Being: Embracing Impermanence in a Technological Age

*How can embracing impermanence reshape our ethics and understanding of identity amid rapid technological change?*

---

## The Flux of Being and Becoming

Sitting with a warm cup of coffee, I often ponder how our sense of self and nature feels so unsteady nowadays — not just because of personal change, but because of the sheer speed at which technology reshapes our environment and bodies. This tension between what "is" and what is "becoming" calls to mind a philosophical conversation that spans centuries, yet seems especially urgent now.

The philosopher Gilles Deleuze famously emphasized "becoming" over static being, inviting us to see identity as a continuous process, a dance rather than a fixed state (Book: "Difference and Repetition" by Gilles Deleuze, 1968). Deleuze’s idea resists the traditional metaphysics that privilege substance and essence — that something is defined by what it is "in itself." Instead, he guides our attention to the flux, to transformation, to the open-ended creativity inherent in existence.

This resonates deeply in a world where technology accelerates change, blurring the lines between human, machine, and environment. Our identities are no longer confined to biological boundaries; they extend and mutate through prosthetics, digital avatars, and cognitive enhancements. Yet, how do we ethically navigate this becoming without losing sight of the value embedded in our natural flux?

## Impermanence Beyond Philosophy: A Practical Lens

Buddhist philosophy, with its teaching of impermanence (anicca), offers a poignant counterpoint. It reminds us that all phenomena — including the self — are transient and interdependent, encouraging acceptance rather than resistance to change. This spiritual insight is not merely contemplative; it holds practical wisdom, especially as we wrestle with technologies promising permanence — digital immortality, mind uploading, genetic editing.

This tension is palpable in recent debates about neurotechnology and brain-computer interfaces. For instance, Elon Musk’s Neuralink project sparks excitement for transcending biological limits but also ethical concern about what it means to alter our minds profoundly. The question arises: are we enhancing our "being," or are we disrupting the natural flow of becoming in ways we don’t fully understand? [Wolfe, 2025](https://example.org/neuralink-ethics-discussion)

## Emergence, Reduction, and the Ethics of Technology

Philosophers of science have long wrestled with emergence — how complex wholes arise from simpler parts without being fully reducible to them. This offers a framework for thinking about technology-enhanced humans. The brain’s emergent properties cannot be entirely predicted from neuronal activity alone, just as a person's identity cannot be wholly reduced to genetic code or implanted devices.

Yet, the impulse to control and optimize our bodies through technology often reflects a reductionist mindset. It’s a tension between honoring the emergent, relational nature of identity and the desire for precise control over our evolution. The ethics here must balance these impulses, recognizing that our "natural" process of becoming includes messiness, unpredictability, and vulnerability — qualities that technology might inadvertently erase or gloss over.

## Lessons from Current Events: The Digital Afterlife Debate

A recent cultural flashpoint illustrates this tension vividly. The controversy over digital afterlife services, which promise to preserve one's digital persona indefinitely, exposes our conflicting desires for permanence and acceptance of impermanence. These services raise questions about consent, identity, and what it means to "exist" after death in a technological form.

Reflecting on these debates, I find echoes of Deleuze’s call to embrace becoming — resisting the urge to freeze life into a fixed digital snapshot. Instead, perhaps we need an ethics that honors transformation, letting go gracefully, and respecting the life cycles inherent in both nature and technology.

## A Cozy Conclusion

Sitting here, watching the slow, natural impermanence of leaves outside my window, I find reassurance. Technology invites us to rethink what it means to be human, to be a self in flux. But embracing impermanence — the beautiful, sometimes unsettling dance of becoming — may be the key to navigating this new terrain ethically and with wisdom.

Ultimately, the question is not whether we can stop change, but how we can live with it thoughtfully, holding both our organic roots and technological branches with care.
