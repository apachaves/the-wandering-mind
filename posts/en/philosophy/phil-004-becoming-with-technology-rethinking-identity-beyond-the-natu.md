# Becoming with Technology: Rethinking Identity Beyond the Natural and Artificial

*What does it mean to be 'natural' when our minds and bodies are continually entangled with technology? Exploring identity through the lens of process philosophy and contemporary ethics.*

## Becoming Beyond Boundaries

In our current age, where smartphones are practically extensions of our nervous systems and AI algorithms influence everything from our moods to our choices, the line between what is "natural" and "artificial" blurs more each day. This friction invites a philosophical question: How do we understand identity when human nature itself is in process, continually shaped by technology? 

Traditional metaphysics often treats identity as a fixed substance — something that remains stable despite change. This perspective struggles when faced with the fluidity of contemporary life, where our minds, bodies, and environments are intertwined in dynamic feedback loops. 

This is where process philosophy, especially as articulated by thinkers like Alfred North Whitehead and more recently by philosophers engaging with contemporary technology, offers a useful framework. Instead of fixed substances, reality is better understood as a series of events and relations — a constant "becoming" rather than static "being." Our identities, then, are not fixed essences but ongoing processes shaped by our interactions, including those with technology.

## Process Philosophy and the Human-Technological Ecosystem

Whitehead’s process philosophy proposes that everything is interconnected and in flux, a web of "actual occasions" that are momentary events rather than enduring things (Book: "Process and Reality" by Alfred North Whitehead, 1929). This view resonates profoundly with the way technology and humans co-evolve. For example, the cybernetic feedback loops between human decisions, AI algorithms, and social media dynamics reveal identity as emergent and relational.

This resonates with the contemporary philosopher Katherine Hayles, who argues in "Unthought" (2017) for a recognition of the distributed nature of cognition — that mind is not confined to the organic brain but extends into technological systems. More recently, discussions around brain-computer interfaces push this even further, blurring the line between human and machine capabilities, challenging the criteria for what counts as "natural." 

## Ethics in the Flux: Enhancement and Authenticity

If identity is a process intertwined with technology, what ethical frameworks should guide enhancements like neural implants, genetic editing, or AI-assisted decision making? The classical tension between authenticity and enhancement looms large here. Some argue that altering ourselves with technology risks losing our "true human nature," while others see enhancement as a natural extension of our evolutionary capacities.

Philosophical voices like Nick Bostrom advocate for enhancement as a moral imperative to overcome our biological limits (Book: "Superintelligence" by Nick Bostrom, 2014). Yet, critics caution that uncritical enthusiasm can overlook the social, political, and ecological contexts that shape these technologies. 

The recent debate surrounding the release of neural augmentation devices — devices that could potentially modulate mood or memory — illustrates this tension vividly (see recent coverage in The New Yorker, 2026). Concerns about identity integrity, consent, and social justice complicate the picture.

Process philosophy invites us to see these tensions not as fixed oppositions but as ongoing negotiations within a dynamic ecosystem. The "natural" is not pristine wilderness untouched by human intervention, nor is the "artificial" merely alien. Both are intertwined processes shaping human identity in relational and emergent ways.

## Towards a Relational Ethics of Becoming

This framework nudges us toward an ethics that values responsiveness and adaptation over rigid rules. It calls for attention to how technologies mediate relationships — between people, and between humans and the more-than-human world. The Brazilian philosopher and anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro’s concept of perspectivism, which emphasizes the multiplicity of worlds and relational identities, can enrich this dialogue by insisting on respect amid difference.

In practice, this means approaching technology not as a tool to conquer nature but as a partner in our ongoing becoming. How we design, adopt, and regulate technologies should be informed by care for the web of relations that constitute our identities.

## Closing Thoughts

In the end, perhaps the question is less about preserving an elusive "natural" self and more about embracing the fluidity of existence — becoming-with technology as a form of life. This perspective doesn't dismiss concerns about ethics, autonomy, or authenticity; rather, it situates them within the lively, evolving processes that define our shared world.

As we navigate these waters, philosophy can offer a compass that honors both the wisdom embedded in natural evolutionary processes and the innovative potentials unlocked by human ingenuity.

By sitting with these tensions, we may find a new way to understand ourselves — not as fixed beings but as ongoing stories of becoming.
