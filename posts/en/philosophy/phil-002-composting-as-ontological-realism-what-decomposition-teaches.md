# Composting as Ontological Realism: What Decomposition Teaches About Identity

*We preserve our dead in sealed boxes, embalmed against the very transformation that defines existence. But what if accepting decomposition is the most honest philosophical position available?*

## The Refusal of Transformation

Western funerary practice is, at its core, a metaphysical argument. When we embalm a body, seal it in a steel casket, and encase that casket in a concrete vault, we are making a claim about identity: that the person *is* the body, and that preserving the body preserves something essential. This is substance dualism enacted in mahogany and formaldehyde.

But consider the alternative. In 2019, Washington State became the first U.S. jurisdiction to legalize [human composting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_organic_reduction) — a process called "natural organic reduction" that transforms a human body into soil within 30 to 60 days. By 2025, seven more states had followed. The company [Recompose](https://www.recompose.life/), founded by Katrina Spade, has processed hundreds of bodies this way, each one becoming roughly a cubic yard of nutrient-rich earth.

This is not merely an ecological choice. It is an ontological statement.

## The Spinozist Reading

Spinoza argued in the *Ethics* (1677) that individual things are not substances but *modes* — temporary configurations of the one infinite substance. Your body is not a thing that *has* atoms; it is a pattern that atoms temporarily *form*. When that pattern dissolves, nothing is lost. The atoms continue. The substance persists. Only the mode changes.

Composting enacts this literally. The carbon in your bones becomes the carbon in a tomato plant. The nitrogen in your muscles feeds the mycelium. You do not "return to nature" because you never left it. You were always nature, temporarily shaped like a person.

This is what Anderson calls "ontological realism about death" — not morbidity, but honesty about what we are.

## The Contemporary Debate

The conversation around human composting has accelerated in recent years. In 2023, California's [AB 351](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB351) went into effect, making it the most populous state to legalize the practice. The Catholic Church has [formally opposed](https://www.ncronline.org/earthbeat/faith/catholic-church-opposes-human-composting-legislation) natural organic reduction, arguing that the body deserves "reverence" incompatible with transformation into soil. This objection is revealing: it assumes that the body's current form is its *proper* form, that transformation is degradation.

But from a pantheist perspective, the opposite is true. The body's current form is one of infinitely many configurations. Insisting on preserving it is like insisting that a river should never reach the sea.

## Carbon Accounting as Modal Honesty

There is a related practice that Anderson describes as "carbon accounting" — tracking one's material flows as a form of self-knowledge. This sounds mundane, but it is philosophically radical. When you trace the carbon in your breakfast cereal back through the supply chain — from the grain field to the atmosphere to the photosynthetic reaction that fixed it — you are performing a kind of scalar meditation. You are seeing yourself not as a consumer but as a node in a biogeochemical cycle.

The [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/) publishes annual carbon budgets that make this visible at planetary scale. In 2024, they reported that human activities released approximately 37.4 billion tonnes of CO₂. Each of us is a tiny fraction of that flow — a mode of the carbon cycle, temporarily conscious of itself.

## The Ethics of Acceptance

None of this implies passivity. Accepting that you are a temporary pattern does not mean you should not care about the pattern. A river cares about its banks even though it knows it will eventually reach the sea. The point is not nihilism but *clarity* — seeing what you are without the distortions of permanence.

Spinoza called this *sub specie aeternitatis* — seeing things under the aspect of eternity. Not from above, not from outside, but from within, with full awareness of one's finitude. Composting is this awareness made material.

The philosopher [Rosi Braidotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosi_Braidotti) calls this "affirmative ethics" — an ethics grounded not in fear of death but in joy at being alive. In her book *The Posthuman* (2013), she argues that accepting our material continuity with non-human nature is not a loss of dignity but a gain in understanding. We are not diminished by being compost. We are enlarged by being part of everything.

Perhaps the most radical thing you can do is plan to become soil.
