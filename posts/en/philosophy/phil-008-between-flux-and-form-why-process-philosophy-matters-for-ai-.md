# Between Flux and Form: Why Process Philosophy Matters for AI Ethics

*In an age of AI, understanding reality as dynamic becoming rather than static being reshapes how we think about intelligence and ethics.*

## Introduction: The Challenge of AI and Ontology

The rapid advance of artificial intelligence reignites old philosophical questions about what it means to be, to know, and to act. But underlying these is a more subtle tension: Should we understand reality—and by extension, AI—as composed of static substances with fixed essences, or as ongoing processes of becoming? This ontological question has profound ethical implications for how we treat AI systems and ourselves.

## Substance Metaphysics versus Process Philosophy

Classical Western metaphysics, with roots in Aristotle and Descartes, tends to conceive things as substances—entities with enduring identities and fixed properties. This view aligns well with the engineering mindset behind much of AI: discrete modules, stable algorithms, well-defined outputs.

In contrast, process philosophy, as developed by Alfred North Whitehead, views reality as a web of events, relations, and continuous change. Nothing remains wholly the same; everything is in flux, interrelated and emergent (Book: "Process and Reality" by Alfred North Whitehead, 1929).

Process philosophy invites us to see AI not as finished products but as living processes interacting with environments, continually evolving in unpredictable ways. This resonates with current AI architectures that learn from data streams and adapt over time.

## The Ethical Stakes: Beyond Control and Optimization

If we view AI purely as objects to be controlled and optimized, we may overlook their embeddedness in social and natural ecosystems. This leads to narrow ethics focusing on safety, fairness, or transparency as static checkpoints.

Process philosophy reminds us that ethical engagement must be ongoing, relational, and responsive. Philosopher Catherine Malabou argues for a concept of "plasticity"—the capacity to be shaped and to shape—which applies to both brains and machines, emphasizing open-ended transformation rather than fixed identity ([Malabou, "The Ontology of the Accident," 2022](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ontology-accident)).

## AI as Becoming: Lessons from Recent Media

A recent discussion at the 2026 World AI Ethics Summit highlighted how AI systems trained on dynamic social data exhibit emergent behaviors not foreseen by their programmers. This unpredictability challenges static regulatory frameworks and calls for ethical models that accept indeterminacy and co-becoming with AI.

Similarly, debates around AI-generated art and creativity reveal tensions between mechanical reproduction and genuine novelty. Process philosophy reframes creativity as a continuous unfolding, not a product to be owned or controlled.

## Implications for Human Identity and Nature

Seeing mind and technology as processes disrupts the neat divide between natural and artificial, human and machine. Philosopher Graham Harman's object-oriented ontology critiques both reductionist science and romantic naturalism by emphasizing the withdrawn, autonomous reality of objects—including technological ones—yet process thinkers would push further toward relational becoming (Harman, "Object-Oriented Ontology," 2018).

This suggests a new humility: we are part of a dance with technologies, ecosystems, and histories, all influencing and reshaping each other endlessly.

## Conclusion: Embracing Flux to Guide Ethical AI

The metaphor of flux over fixed form invites us to rethink AI ethics not as a checklist but as an evolving dialogue. It encourages openness to surprise, relational responsibility, and attentiveness to context. In a world where boundaries blur between mind, nature, and machine, process philosophy offers a framework to navigate complexity with care.

In the words of Whitehead, "The art of progress is to preserve order amid change and to preserve change amid order."
