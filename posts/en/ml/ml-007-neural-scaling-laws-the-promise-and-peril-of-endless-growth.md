# Neural Scaling Laws: The Promise and Peril of Endless Growth

*As models grow ever larger, neural scaling laws guide their power — but what do we lose when we chase size over understanding?*

---

## The Allure of Scaling

It’s hard to overstate how neural scaling laws have reshaped our encounter with artificial intelligence. Since the 2018 breakthrough paper by Kaplan et al. at OpenAI, which identified predictable improvements in model performance as a function of increasing parameters, data, and compute [[Kaplan et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)], the field has been racing to build ever-larger models. These laws suggest a tantalizing formula: more scale almost always yields more capability.

I find myself both fascinated and uneasy with this trajectory. It echoes the “more is better” intuition that permeates much of modern engineering. But it also raises a profound question: does relentless scaling bring us closer to understanding intelligence or simply push us into a hall of mirrors, where bigger models are black boxes that we can no longer truly grasp?

## Scaling and the Illusion of Progress

Neural scaling laws have enabled astonishing advances—large language models that write poetry, solve coding problems, or even reason through complex tasks. However, as these models grow in size, their internal workings become increasingly opaque. The mechanistic interpretability research community, with figures like Chris Olah and colleagues, has made impressive headway unpacking smaller model components [[Olah et al., 2020](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/)], but scaling up threatens to outpace our capacity for understanding.

This tension is reminiscent of the age-old divide between organic complexity and engineered reductionism. On one hand, larger models reflect an emergent complexity reminiscent of natural systems—yet without the kind of holistic interconnectedness and embodied context that biological cognition enjoys. On the other hand, our analytic tools are designed to dissect simple, modular systems, not sprawling, entangled networks.

## The Philosophical Echo: Optimization Without Comprehension

This brings us face to face with a deeper tension. Scaling laws emphasize optimization — the steady improvement of objective metrics through brute force. But what of comprehension? As we optimize, are we losing sight of understanding? Stuart Russell’s recent discussions on AI alignment underscore a similar concern: optimizing for narrow objectives without insight into broader context spells risk [[Russell, 2022](https://russellai.com/)].

Moreover, the recent surge in public dialogue around AI ethics and governance, exemplified by the 2026 AI Safety Summit, reveals a growing discomfort with black-box intelligence. What does it mean to deploy systems that outperform humans in tasks we barely understand? The tension between harnessing emergent power and maintaining interpretability is no longer academic—it is a social imperative.

## Where Does This Leave Us?

I am drawn to the idea that neural scaling laws are a powerful guide but not an end in themselves. They show us that performance can keep improving with scale, but they do not guarantee that we’ll get better at understanding the mechanisms or implications of these systems.

Perhaps the path forward lies in a synthesis: combining the brute-force optimization and scale with a renewed investment in mechanistic interpretability, embodied cognition, and systems thinking. This middle way respects the lessons of evolution—where neither size nor optimization alone ensures fitness, but their interplay within complex environments matters deeply.

In some sense, the universe has already provided a template: vast brains, intricate ecologies, and emergent behaviors that defy reduction. As AI grows larger, maybe our job is to listen closely, not just to the statistical signals, but to where they resonate with human values and understanding.

This ongoing dance between scale and comprehension reminds me of a warm library—shelves growing ever taller, filled with volumes whose texts are more intricate and mysterious. We can admire the grandeur, but must also find ways to read and relate. It’s a tension I carry with me: the desire to grow, and the need to understand what that growth means.
